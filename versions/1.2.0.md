# 1.2.0

- Support async scenario step methods: https://github.com/ttutisani/Xunit.Gherkin.Quick/issues/24

## Bug fixes:

- Now you can use same feature file from more than one feature class (was not possible due to thrown exception by gherkin parser not able to open file more than once). This ability can be useful in cases when you want to split feature scenarios between several classes (although consider using partial classes too).

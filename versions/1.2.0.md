# 1.2.0 (Release Candidate)

- Support of table data arguments (pending).
- Support async scenario step methods: https://github.com/ttutisani/Xunit.Gherkin.Quick/issues/24

## Bug fixes:

- Now you can use same feature file from more than one feature class (used to throw exception due to gherkin parser not able to open file more than once).

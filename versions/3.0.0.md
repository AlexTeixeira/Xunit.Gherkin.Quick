# 3.0.0 (Release Candidate)

NOTE: this is not a backwards compatible release. Please see notes about backwards compatibility below.

## Features:

- Scenario Outline support: https://github.com/ttutisani/Xunit.Gherkin.Quick/blob/master/scenario-outline.md
- Make Output property private and thus hidden from derived feature classes; provide alternative for acquiring Output reference. (PENDING)

## About Backwards Compatibility

This is not a backwards compatible release because of the following changes:

1. Before this release, if you had defined a scenario outline in the feature file, it would be handled as a regular scenario (examples would be ignored). That was an unnoticed side effect which was fixed when implementing scenario outline support. After this release, if you define a scenario outline in the feature file, it will be handled as needed (by turning each example row into a scenario).
